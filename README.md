# NightwatchJS test cases

The repository contains a very basic Automation test case. I am working to convert the above test into a framework for a better end to end Automation.
<br/>
Steps to run the Test case:-<br/>
1 Install node and npm to your system home. <br/>
2 Clone the above repo to your local machine. <br/>
3 Navigate to the repository and execute the command "nightwatch" <br/><br/>

The above framework contains chromedriver for Chrome version 80.
